# CDR STL Forecast & Agent Scheduling

FastAPI application for forecasting contact-centre call demand from historical CDR files, calculating Erlang C staffing, and generating monthly agent rosters.

**Application version:** `4.1.0`

**Local dashboard:** `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`

The browser submits a background forecast job, displays progress and charts, builds monthly schedules, and supports leave replacements, shift swaps, and yearly CSV downloads. [API documentation](api_documentation.md) contains endpoint examples and response details.

## Quick start

Use Python 3.10 or later. Dependencies are listed in [requirements.txt](requirements.txt): pandas, NumPy, statsmodels, pyworkforce, FastAPI, Uvicorn, and python-multipart. There is no frontend build step.

### Windows PowerShell

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

### Linux / macOS

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

Run commands from the repository root. The compatibility entry point `python -m uvicorn api:app --reload` also works.

| URL | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `/` | Dashboard |
| `/health` | Health and application version |
| `/docs` | Swagger UI |
| `/redoc` | ReDoc |
| `/openapi.json` | Generated OpenAPI schema |

The dashboard loads Chart.js from jsDelivr. The application creates `static/` and `logs/` when needed and requires write access for logs and temporary uploads.

## Dashboard workflow

1. Upload historical CDR files, one calendar year per file.
2. Set **Target answer seconds** and **Target service level %**, then select **Create STL forecast**.
3. Wait for the background job. Review summaries and monthly, weekday, and time-of-day charts.
4. Select a date and table interval to inspect staffing. Download the hourly forecast for the whole output year.
5. Select a schedule month and optionally enter **Available agent count**. Leave it blank for automatic minimum-headcount estimation, then select **Generate Monthly Schedule**.
6. View the whole roster or filter by calendar week. Apply leave with a selected replacement, or swap two agents' shifts.
7. Select **Download Yearly Roster CSV** to export 12 monthly tables, generating missing months as needed.

## STL inputs

### Inputs exposed by the dashboard

The forecast form exposes these three inputs. Other forecasting parameters are supplied by the browser or use the API default.

| Dashboard input | Request field | Initial value | Behaviour |
|---|---|---|---|
| Upload Historical CDR Data | `files` | Required | Multiple `.csv` or `.txt` files; one distinct historical year per file |
| Target answer seconds | `target_seconds` | `20` | Number of seconds; browser minimum `0`, step `0.01` |
| Target service level % | `target_service_level` | `80` | Browser range `0.01`-`99.99`, step `0.01`; API percentage conversion described below |

### Parameters used by the dashboard

| Request field | Dashboard value | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `interval_minutes` | `30` | Forecast and Erlang C source intervals are 30 minutes |
| `forecast_days` | `365` | Full output year; expands to 366 days for a leap year |
| `seasonal_period` | `336` | One week: 48 intervals/day multiplied by 7 |
| `trend_lookback_days` | `90` | Recent trend window for linear extrapolation |
| `shrinkage` | `30` | 30% shrinkage |
| `include_forecast_rows` | `true` | Return rows needed by the tables and scheduler |
| `max_agents` | Not sent; API default `1000` | Maximum permitted raw or scheduled staffing per interval |

Changing the forecast table's display interval does not change STL inputs or rerun Erlang C. The table defaults to **1 hr** and supports **0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 8 hr** groupings. The forecast CSV always uses 1-hour groups.

### Inputs accepted by the forecast API

Both `POST /api/v1/cdr/stl-forecast` and `POST /api/v1/cdr/stl-forecast/async` accept `multipart/form-data` with these fields:

| Field | Type | Default | Validation / meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `files` | Repeated uploaded file | Required | 1-20 non-empty `.csv`/`.txt` files; at most 100 MiB per file |
| `interval_minutes` | Integer | `30` | Positive exact divisor of 1440 |
| `forecast_days` | Integer | `365` | 1-3650; `365` represents the full output year, including leap day |
| `seasonal_period` | Integer or omitted | Automatic | Seasonal cycle length in intervals; effective period must be at least 2 |
| `trend_lookback_days` | Integer | `90` | At least 7; uses at most the available historical trend |
| `target_seconds` | Number | `20` | Non-negative Erlang C answer-time target in seconds |
| `target_service_level` | Number | `80` | Converted fraction must be strictly between 0 and 1 |
| `shrinkage` | Number | `30` | Converted fraction must be at least 0 and less than 1 |
| `max_agents` | Integer | `1000` | 1-10,000; fails if either raw or scheduled positions exceed this value |
| `include_forecast_rows` | Boolean | `true` | `false` returns summaries/charts with an empty `forecast` array |

Percentage conversion divides values greater than 1 by 100; values at or below 1 are interpreted as fractions. Thus `80` and `0.8` both mean 80%, and `30` and `0.3` both mean 30% shrinkage. Exactly `1` means 100% and is rejected for both service level and shrinkage. Submit numeric form values, without a `%` suffix.

Omitting `seasonal_period` uses `(1440 // interval_minutes) * 7`. The current implementation also treats `0` as automatic. A nonzero supplied value must resolve to at least 2 intervals, and the historical series must contain at least two such cycles.

Valid interval examples include `5`, `10`, `15`, `20`, `30`, `60`, `120`, `240`, and `480`; `35` is invalid. Larger API horizons are supported, but the dashboard and yearly downloads are designed around one output year. Scheduling request arrays have their own row limits.

## CDR input and cleaning

Files have seven columns in this order, with no header:

```text
source,destination,call_datetime,duration,disposition,unique_id,caller_id
```

The reader tries UTF-16 with tabs, UTF-8 with BOM and commas, then Latin-1 with commas. It first uses pandas' C parser and falls back to its Python parser on a parsing error.

| Field | Format / use |
|---|---|
| `source` | Non-empty calling identifier |
| `destination` | Non-empty destination; the value `s` is excluded, case-insensitively |
| `call_datetime` | `%Y-%b-%d %I:%M:%S %p`, for example `2025-Jan-15 09:42:11 AM` |
| `duration` | `HH:MM:SS`, for example `00:03:12` |
| `disposition` | Only `Answered` retained, case-insensitively |
| `unique_id` | Read as an input field |
| `caller_id` | Read as an input field |

Cleaning removes unparseable dates/durations, missing source/destination values, excluded destinations/dispositions, and durations outside 1 second to 4 hours inclusive. These cleaning defaults are internal function settings, not forecast form fields.

Every file must retain at least one valid answered call and exactly one calendar year after cleaning. Duplicate years across files are rejected. Full-year data is expected for forecasting quality, but the implementation does not verify that calls cover every month: it fills the year's interval grid with zero-call intervals where data is absent. Input years need not be consecutive.

## Forecast calculations

### Historical series and STL

For each historical year, the application sums calls and handle time into fixed intervals, computes AHT as handle time divided by calls, and fills a complete calendar-year interval grid. Historical February 29 intervals are removed before the yearly frames are concatenated in chronological order.

STL decomposes historical calls into trend, seasonality, and residuals. The implementation uses robust fitting, a seasonal smoother length of 7, `seasonal_jump=1`, and calculated trend/low-pass interpolation jumps. These are implementation settings, not public request fields.

Future calls are calculated by:

1. Fitting a line to the last `trend_lookback_days` of the fitted trend.
2. Extrapolating that line over the forecast horizon.
3. Repeating the final fitted seasonal cycle over the same horizon.
4. Adding trend and seasonality, rounding to whole calls, and clipping negative values to zero.

Residual noise is not extrapolated. Future AHT comes from historical call-weighted AHT for the corresponding weekday/time slot, with global historical AHT as a fallback.

### Forecast calendar

`output_year` is the latest historical year plus one. Forecasts start on January 1 at midnight. The annual request `forecast_days=365` covers January 1-December 31, including February 29 in leap years. Other horizon values keep their specified count of consecutive calendar days.

For an annual leap-year forecast, `days` is `366`, while `parameters.forecast_days` retains the requested `365`. At 30-minute intervals, annual output contains 17,520 rows in an ordinary year or 17,568 in a leap year. Historical leap-day removal does not apply to forecast dates. Regenerate older forecasts to include leap day.

### Erlang C staffing

```text
traffic_erlangs = call_volume * aht_seconds / interval_seconds
```

`pyworkforce.queuing.ErlangC` calculates raw positions, scheduled positions after shrinkage, service level, waiting probability, and occupancy. Average speed of answer is calculated from waiting probability, AHT, raw positions, and traffic. Staffing calls are cached using call volume, AHT rounded to two decimals, interval duration, targets, shrinkage, and the agent limit.

Zero-call intervals return zero traffic/agents, 100% service level, zero waiting probability, zero occupancy, and zero ASA. Validation still applies to the request settings.

### Forecast response

The response contains a `forecast` array, `charts`, `parameters`, and summary fields such as `dataset_count`, `historical_years`, `output_year`, `days`, `forecast_interval_count`, `total_predicted_calls`, maximum staffing, peak interval, source-file cleaning counts, and decomposition statistics.

The actual forecast row columns are:

```text
interval_start, date, day_of_year, month, day, weekday, weekday_name,
hour, minute, call_volume, aht_seconds, traffic_erlangs, raw_agents,
scheduled_agents, service_level_percent, probability_waiting_percent,
occupancy_percent, asa_seconds
```

`weekday` is 0 for Monday through 6 for Sunday. `day_of_year` is the calendar day-of-year. `interval_start` is serialized as `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS` without a timezone suffix.

Summary service level, occupancy, and ASA are arithmetic means over forecast intervals. Summary AHT uses weights `max(call_volume, 1)`. These summary calculations differ from the call-weighted hourly table calculations below. Charts contain monthly and daily totals plus weekday and time-of-day averages; see [API documentation](api_documentation.md) for their response structure.

## API routes and background jobs

| Method | Route | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/` | Serve the dashboard, or service information if the HTML is absent |
| `GET` | `/health` | Return `{"status":"healthy","version":"4.1.0"}` |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/cdr/stl-forecast` | Return the complete forecast synchronously |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/cdr/stl-forecast/async` | Save uploads and submit a background forecast job |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/jobs/{job_id}` | Return progress, status, error, and completed result |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/jobs/{job_id}/stream` | Stream progress as server-sent events |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/schedule/monthly` | Generate a monthly roster from JSON forecast rows |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/schedule/leave` | Apply leave using manual or automatic replacement |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/schedule/swap` | Swap two working agents' shifts on one date |

The dashboard uses the async forecast route and polls every 500 ms. Submission returns HTTP 200 with `job_id`, `status: queued`, `poll_url`, and `stream_url`. Job statuses are `queued`, `processing`, `completed`, and `failed`. Read `result.forecast` from a completed polling response; failed jobs expose an `error`. Polling responses have `result: null` until completion.

SSE events contain progress/status and `has_result`, not the full forecast. Retrieve the polling endpoint for the result after completion. Unknown jobs return HTTP 404.

Example async submission in a POSIX shell (`curl.exe` can be used with equivalent arguments in PowerShell):

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/cdr/stl-forecast/async \
  -F "files=@calls_2025.csv" \
  -F "interval_minutes=30" \
  -F "forecast_days=365" \
  -F "seasonal_period=336" \
  -F "trend_lookback_days=90" \
  -F "target_seconds=20" \
  -F "target_service_level=80" \
  -F "shrinkage=30" \
  -F "include_forecast_rows=true"
```

## Monthly scheduling

Send JSON containing `forecast`, `year`, `month` (1-12), and optional `agent_count` to `/api/v1/schedule/monthly`. Forecast rows must contain `interval_start` and `scheduled_agents`; use the original forecast response, not the aggregated CSV. `agent_count` is null/omitted for automatic estimation, or an integer from 1 to 10,000.

| Shift code | Dashboard label | Hours |
|---|---|---|
| `NIGHT` | `00:00-08:00` | 00:00-08:00 |
| `MORNING` | `08:00-16:00` | 08:00-16:00 |
| `EVENING` | `16:00-00:00` | 16:00-24:00 |

Each date/shift requires the maximum `scheduled_agents` from its forecast intervals. Headcount is estimated across Monday-Sunday weeks as the maximum of `ceil(weekly required shift slots / 5)` and peak total daily staffing. A supplied count below this estimate is rejected.

The generator assigns at most one shift per day, at most five working days per week, and at least eight hours between successive work shifts within the generated month. Candidates are ranked by weekly workdays, total assignments, shift-specific assignments, and agent ID. All remaining agent/date combinations become `OFF`. Agents are named `Agent 001`, `Agent 002`, etc.

The response has `schedule` rows and a `summary` with headcount, assignment totals, `coverage_shortage`, `coverage_ok`, and per-shift coverage. The headcount estimate does not guarantee the greedy assignment will fill every shift: inspect coverage fields even after HTTP 200. Automatic estimation of zero agents for a month with no staffing demand is rejected by the generator's positive-agent-count check.

Months are generated independently. Weekly limits and rest checks do not carry prior-month assignments into a new monthly generation. The yearly CSV combines these monthly schedules; it does not optimize a continuous annual roster.

### Leave and shift swaps

Leave requests contain `forecast`, the current `schedule`, `agent_id`, and `leave_date`. Optional fields are `replacement_agent_id` (null or 1-100 characters) and `auto_assign` (default `true`).

The dashboard uses manual replacement: `auto_assign: false` and the selected replacement ID. If coverage is required, an OFF replacement must remain within the weekly work limit, or a transfer must preserve staffing in the source shift. Manual replacements skip rest validation and never fall back to a different agent. Missing/invalid manual choices return HTTP 400 when coverage is needed.

API clients can omit both optional fields for automatic coverage. Providing a replacement ID always selects manual mode. Automatic mode tries an eligible OFF replacement, then a transfer from another shift, with eight-hour rest validation. A selected automatic candidate failing rest validation can cause HTTP 400; the implementation does not exhaustively search every alternative candidate.

When leave is applied, the original assignment is saved and the agent's shift/status becomes `LEAVE`. Sufficient staffing needs no replacement. Agents already OFF or already on leave can produce `NO_ACTION`. Result methods include `NO_ACTION`, `NO_REPLACEMENT_REQUIRED`, `OFF_AGENT_COVER`, `SHIFT_TRANSFER`, and `UNRESOLVED`; always inspect `result.resolved` and store the returned schedule.

Swap requests contain the current `schedule`, `agent_1`, `agent_2`, and `swap_date`. Both agents must have exactly one row on that date, be working different shifts, and satisfy the eight-hour rest check after exchange. The validator checks working assignments on the previous and next calendar dates present in the supplied schedule.

Updated rows may include `original_shift_code`, `original_shift`, `previous_shift_code`, `previous_shift`, and `assignment_type`. Assignment types include `LEAVE_COVER`, `SHIFT_TRANSFER`, and `SHIFT_SWAP`. Later operations must use the latest returned schedule.

## Dashboard filters and CSV exports

### Forecast table and CSV

The table shows a selected date and display interval. Calls are summed; AHT and service level are call-weighted averages, with arithmetic-average fallback for zero-call groups. Agent counts show peak source-interval requirements. AHT and service level have two decimal places.

**Download Forecast CSV** exports the available output year at a fixed 1-hour interval, independent of the selected date/display interval. The filename is `stl_erlang_forecast_<year>_hourly.csv`. It uses exactly these table columns:

```csv
Interval,Calls,AHT,Raw agents,Scheduled agents,Service level %
2026-01-01 00:00 - 01:00,40,175.00,4,5,87.50
```

A complete annual forecast produces 8,760 CSV data rows, or 8,784 in a leap year. Hour labels use forecast wall-clock dates, and the final hour ends at `24:00`. API JSON retains the original interval rows and additional staffing fields.

### Roster week filter

The roster defaults to **Whole month**. **Week 1**, **Week 2**, etc. represent Monday-Sunday calendar weeks clipped to the month. For April 2026, Week 1 is Wednesday April 1-Sunday April 5, and Week 2 is April 6-12. Four, five, or six buttons appear as needed, without date ranges in their labels.

Selecting a week filters date columns and recalculates **Total shifts** for the visible dates. Leave/swap updates preserve the selection. Generating a new roster resets to **Whole month**.

### Yearly roster CSV

**Download Yearly Roster CSV** creates `agent_roster_<year>.csv` with 12 January-December sections separated by blank rows. Each section contains a month title, an `Agent` column, each calendar day formatted like `01 Wed`, and `Total shifts`. Rows contain the dashboard's shift labels, `OFF`, or `LEAVE`. Totals count `status: WORK` assignments only.

The download exports full months regardless of the week filter. It reuses monthly rosters cached during the current forecast session, including leave and swap edits. Missing months are generated sequentially through `/api/v1/schedule/monthly`, using that month's forecast rows and the agent-count setting from the most recent successful dashboard generation. Null headcount calculates each missing month's minimum independently. Cached months keep their original staffing settings and edits.

Missing forecast data, insufficient requested headcount, or monthly-generation errors stop the download without saving a partial CSV. Successful generated months remain cached for retries. A returned monthly coverage shortage is not itself treated as an export error.

Both exports are built in the browser as UTF-8 CSV with BOM and CRLF row endings. Commas, quotes, and line breaks are escaped. CSV keeps table rows and columns, but not dashboard colours or separate spreadsheet worksheets; the 12 roster sections share one file.

## Configuration, state, and logging

[app/config.py](app/config.py) defines the current limits; these values are Python constants, not environment-variable settings.

| Constant | Value | Scope |
|---|---|---|
| `MAX_UPLOAD_BYTES` | `100 * 1024 * 1024` | Maximum bytes per uploaded file (100 MiB) |
| `MAX_UPLOAD_FILES` | `20` | Files per forecast submission |
| `MAX_FORECAST_DAYS` | `3650` | Maximum requested forecast horizon |
| `MAX_AGENT_COUNT` | `10000` | Request limit for interval staffing cap and monthly headcount |
| `MAX_FORECAST_ROWS` | `40000` | Maximum forecast rows in monthly/leave requests |
| `MAX_SCHEDULE_ROWS` | `50000` | Maximum schedule rows in leave/swap requests |
| `MAX_WORKER_THREADS` | `8` | Background forecast thread-pool size |

Schedule/leave/swap agent IDs have a maximum of 100 characters; date strings have a maximum of 10 characters and should use `YYYY-MM-DD`. Very large generated monthly rosters can exceed the row limit for subsequent leave/swap requests.

Job status/results live in process memory and are lost on restart. Separate server processes do not share jobs; the current background manager is a local thread pool. Forecast and schedule state are not stored in a database. The browser caches monthly rosters, but starting a new forecast clears that cache, and reloading the page loses browser state.

Requests are logged with method, path, status, duration, and an ID returned in `X-Request-ID`. Background workers log progress and errors. Logs go to the console and `logs/app_<date>.log` using daily rotation configured with `backupCount=30`. Temporary upload files are removed after processing.

## Errors and validation

| Status / result | Meaning |
|---|---|
| HTTP 400 | Data or calculation errors, such as duplicate historical years, unsupported files, invalid forecast settings, insufficient headcount, or invalid leave/swap operations |
| HTTP 404 | Unknown background job |
| HTTP 413 | Uploaded file exceeds the size limit |
| HTTP 422 | FastAPI/Pydantic request type, required-field, or declared model-bound validation |
| HTTP 500 | Unexpected operation failure |
| Job `status: failed` | Background forecast failed after submission; inspect its `error` |
| `coverage_ok: false` | Monthly roster returned with a staffing shortage |
| Leave `resolved: false` | Leave result is unresolved; inspect its method and coverage |

HTTP errors generally contain a `detail` field. Background completion and schedule coverage must be checked separately from the initial HTTP status.

## Development checks

Compile application modules:

```bash
python -m compileall app api.py calculator.py
```

If the local `tests/` directory is present, run its unittest checks:

```bash
python -m unittest discover -s tests -p "test_*.py"
```

The current `.gitignore` excludes `tests/`, so local tests may not be available in a fresh clone. Postman files in `postman/` currently contain placeholder requests and an empty base URL; configure them before use. The notebook and refactoring notes are supporting material; runtime behaviour is implemented in `app/` and `static/index.html`.
